***PLEASE READ FIRST!!!***

We know that we didn't interpretate well the meaning of the categories and subcategories (we didn't split accordingly to the character "."), but we found out of our mistake the last day of submission and decided to leave the exercises unmodified.
With more time at disposition and less work to do for other classes we would have modified directly the csv files and split the categories and subcategories with regex or split fuction (valueting which one costs less computationally speaking) and import the csv files already prepared. We would have had categories and subcategories stored in separated columns.

We apologize for our misunderstanding!

***Dataset***
